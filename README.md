## How to get data

You have to use [this](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to get all your data. You first have to create an api key then you are free to use it.
[Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

## How to store data

To store data about user we will use localeStorage. This is unsafe for this kind of data but this is not the purpose of the course.
